# Louis-Module-4-Webapi
I was tasked with creating a blog to post on my progress of becoming a web developer. I have created a form that accepts input and outputs it to a new page in a neat row. I also made sure to implement a darkmode. Lastly I made sure to leave the code better than I found it.

Assets Folder containing:
* CSS Folder
